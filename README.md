# RFM Analysis of an E-Commerce Bookstore

**First Stage Delivery of the Project / Tech & Non-Tech Presentation**

**Dataset Description:**
The dataset contains the frequency of purchases, number of purchases, and amount of money purchased by the customer, as well as the categories of books purchased by the customer.

**Business Problem:**
The current ecommerce platform relies on a 'most popular' item recommendation strategy to boost cart additions and increase average purchase sizes. However, this approach falls short in addressing individual customer preferences.

**Analysis Goal:**
Our objective involves utilizing customer transaction data to generate personalized recommendations, with the aim of enhancing engagement and sales beyond the constraints of the current approach.
